# Notifications for Facebook

Small Android app for getting notified (friends, messages and notifications) while being privacy and battery friendly. It doesn't require the Facebook Platform to be turned on. It plays nicely with [SlimSocial for Facebook](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=SlimSOcial&fdid=it.rignanese.leo.slimfacebook).
